# Classification-and-Regression-in-R

Within this project, I delved into the realms of Classification and Regression concepts. My exploration involved the manipulation of substantial volumes of data extracted from two distinct datasets: the WHO Suicide Statistics and the Stellar Classification Data Set - SDSS17. Employing a range of techniques for data cleansing and presentation, I harnessed a diverse array of models, including Linear Regression Models, k-Nearest-Neighbor (kNN) algorithm, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Decision Trees.
