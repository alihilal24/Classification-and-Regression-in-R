# Classification-and-Regression-in-R

In this project, I explored Classification and Regression concepts. I manipulated large quantaties of data from two data sets, WHO Suicide Statistics and Stellar Classification Data Set - SDSS17. I used varirios techniques for data cleaning and presentation, and used a plethora of models such as Linear Regression Models, k-Nearest-Number (kNN), Support Vector Machine(SVM), and Decesion Trees. 
The final documents can be found here, [Classification](https://github.com/alihilal24/Classification-and-Regression-in-R/blob/master/RProject_Classification.pdf) and [Regression](https://github.com/alihilal24/Classification-and-Regression-in-R/blob/master/RProject_Regression.pdf)
